The author had a clear concept and provided an original illustration to express her vision, aiming for a unique, personal cover that reflects the main character’s journey. The design needed to be accessible and engaging for all readers—including those less familiar with books—and work seamlessly in both English and Spanish, across print and digital formats.",solution:"As Waia was self-published, there was a focus on keeping production costs low to maximize author royalties. I shaped the book’s visual identity based off the author’s original materials, which included both text and illustrations. The cover was based on one of the author's illustrations, which was then cleaned up and refined to boost impact while preserving its character. The organic typography pairs with the tone of the story and the author’s hand-painted and drawn illustrations. Careful attention to both layout and fine typographic details ensured clarity and a smooth reading experience. Each version was thoughtfully adapted for language and format, resulting in a polished, consistent design that supports the narrative and draws readers in.",thumbnail:{caption:"Cover of Waia",path:"/waia/cover.png"},images:[{caption:"Cover of Waia",path:"/waia/cover1.png"},{caption:"Cover of Waia",path:"waia/cover2.png"},{caption:"Cover of Waia",path:"waia/cover3.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread1.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread2.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread3.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread4.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread5.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread6.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread7.png"},{caption:"Spread of Waia",path:"waia/spread8.png"}]},{title:"Animal Farm",color:"",link:"/animal",context:"Coursework, Editorial Design Specialist (Cursiva)",year:"2024",areas:["Editorial Design","Book Design","Typography"],description:"Cover design for a special edition of Animal Farm, aiming to appeal to a young adult audience.",brief:"Cover design for a special edition of 'Animal Farm' by George Orwell. The goal is to create a cover that clearly represents the work and differentiates this edition from others with an appealing design for a young audience.",solution:"The cover design mixes photographic and typographic elements to capture the chaos at the core of the story. It uses just three inks—red, green, and black—with carefully chosen tones to keep the colors vibrant and clean. Green dominates the palette, with a strong red contrast that helps the book stand out from more traditional editions that often use muted, earthy tones.

The books are distinguished by typography, color, and composition. My father’s Chilean book uses bold imagery, a serif typeface, and deep red tones to evoke savory flavors, while my mother’s Finnish book features smaller pieces, a sans-serif typeface, and lighter blue tones, reflecting sweeter dishes.

Instead of relying on a monochromatic palette, I introduced red, light pink, and deep blue to convey the brand’s uniqueness. The logo, composed in lowercase to stand out from competitors, combines a modern sans-serif typeface with a traditional serif, symbolizing the fusion of strength and elegance. The symbol, made from a continuous line that forms a closed shape, represents the cycle of reinvention.
