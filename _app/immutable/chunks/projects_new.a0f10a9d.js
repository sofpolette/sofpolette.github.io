Intense emotions—such as stress, anxiety, and frustration—significantly impact students' well-being and academic performance. A primary challenge was to useful information and techniques in an engaging and accessible manner, catering to a diverse student audience that varies in gender, age, and personal experiences.",solution:"A digital platform was developed to promote self-awareness and emotional self-management. The design process was iterative, emphasizing accessibility and engagement by breaking content into small, easily digestible fragments, complemented by illustrations that aid interpretation and captivate users. This project aimed to foster an exploratory approach, encouraging students to delve into their emotions without the pressure of rapidly achieving emotional well-being.",thumbnail:{caption:"Itinerary",path:"/influyo/itinerary.png"},images:[{caption:"Promotional stickers",path:"influyo/stickers.png"},{caption:"Homepage",path:"influyo/homepage.png"},{caption:"Emotional ID process",path:"influyo/emotional-ID.png"},{caption:"Itinerary",path:"influyo/itinerary.png"},{caption:"Educational cards",path:"influyo/cards.jpg"},{caption:"Thesis promotional poster",path:"influyo/plafon2.jpg"},{caption:"Promotional tote bag",path:"influyo/tote.png"},{caption:"Launch campaign kit",path:"influyo/stationary.png"},{caption:"Logo",path:"influyo/logo.jpg"},{caption:"Symbol",path:"influyo/symbol.jpg"},{caption:"GIF Logo",path:"influyo/gif-logo.gif"},{caption:"Icons for content categorization",path:"influyo/icons.jpg"},{caption:"Promotional stickers",path:"influyo/laptop.jpg"},{caption:"Educational cards",path:"influyo/cards.gif"},{caption:"Promotional tote bag",path:"influyo/tote.png"},{caption:"Thesis promotional poster",path:"influyo/plafon.jpg"}]},{title:"Margenus",color:"#EDABD9",link:"/margenus",context:"Coursework, collaboration with Fashion Design student",year:"2022",areas:["Branding","Visual Identity","Naming","Merchandising"],description:"A striking yet refined visual identity for an emerging fashion brand, dedicated to redefining luxury for professional women.",brief:"Margenus is an emerging fashion brand with a mission to redefine luxury for professional women. The goal was to develop a brand identity that captured the designer’s unique approach to fashion while appealing to women who value individuality, boldness, and sustainability. A key challenge was setting the brand apart in a fashion landscape where most competitors use monochromatic, all-caps logos, while also highlighting its focus on upcycling.",solution:"The brand differentiates itself through its use of color and typography. Instead of relying on a monochromatic palette, I introduced red, light pink, and deep blue to convey the brand’s uniqueness. The logo, composed in lowercase to stand out from competitors, combines a modern sans-serif typeface with a traditional serif, symbolizing the fusion of strength and elegance. The symbol, made from a continuous line that forms a closed shape, represents the cycle of reinvention. Corporate patterns deconstruct and reuse this symbol to reinforce the brand’s emphasis on upcycling and sustainability.",thumbnail:{caption:"Animated GIF",path:"/margenus/tags.gif"},images:[{caption:"Tags",path:"margenus/tags.jpg"},{caption:"Bags",path:"margenus/bags.jpg"},{caption:"Packaging",path:"margenus/pack.jpg"},{caption:"Lanyard",path:"margenus/lanyard.jpg"},{caption:"Promotional sweatshirt",path:"margenus/sweatshirt.jpg"},{caption:"Corporate vehicle",path:"margenus/van.jpg"},{caption:"Promotional t-shirt",path:"margenus/tshirt.jpg"},{caption:"Billboard",path:"margenus/mupi.jpg"},{caption:"Stand",path:"margenus/sign.jpg"},{caption:"Corporate tape",path:"margenus/tape.jpg"},{caption:"Color palette",path:"margenus/color.jpg"},{caption:"Logo",path:"margenus/logo.jpg"},{caption:"Symbol",path:"margenus/symbol.jpg"}]},{title:"GL Law Firm",color:"#EBEEED",link:"/megl",context:["Client work"],year:"2022",areas:["Branding","Visual Identity","Stationary Design"],description:"Visual identity for a law firm known for its expertise and its approachable, client-focused service.",brief:"The law firm Gutiérrez Ledesma approached me to develop a visual identity that reflected their values of tradition, professionalism, and commitment to justice. The biggest challenge was to avoid the visual clichés of the legal sector, such as scales or the goddess Themis, in order to create a brand that truly stood out from the competition.",solution:"I drew inspiration from Ancient Greece to design an identity that conveys the firm's tradition and experience. I used a neutral color palette that reflects the firm's professionalism, complemented by warm bronze to add approachability. The symbol I created is a monogram that merges the Greek letters Gamma and Lambda, representing the firm's initials in a unique and sophisticated way. The result of this fusion also resembles the letter M, which is the initial of the lawyer’s name.",thumbnail:{caption:"Animated GIF",path:"/megl/megl.gif"},images:[{caption:"Corporate stationary",path:"megl/stationary2.png"},{caption:"Corporate stamp",path:"megl/stamp.jpg"},{caption:"Corporate notebook",path:"megl/notebook.png"},{caption:"Corporate stationary",path:"megl/stationary.jpg"},{caption:"Vinyl",path:"megl/vinyl.png"},{caption:"Process",path:"megl/process1.png"},{caption:"Process",path:"megl/process2.png"},{caption:"Process",path:"megl/process3.png"},{caption:"Color palette",path:"megl/color.png"},{caption:"Logo",path:"megl/logo.png"},{caption:"Scales",path:"megl/scale.png"},{caption:"Corporate card",path:"megl/card.png"},{caption:"Special signature",path:"megl/signature1.png"},{caption:"Themis",path:"megl/themis.png"},{caption:"Special signature",path:"megl/signature2.png"}]},{title:"Cookbooks",color:"#FFFCC5",link:"/cookbooks",context:"Coursework",year:"2023",areas:["Editorial","Photography","Typography"],description:"A series of two cookbooks that explore heritage through shared recipes and traditions.",brief:"This project is a personal exploration of my heritage through family recipes and traditions. These cookbooks also serve as a family archive, connecting generations through shared culinary experiences. The main challenge was creating a cohesive set while ensuring each book reflected the unique cultural backgrounds of both sides of my family.",solution:"To unify the distinct heritages, I cooked and photographed the recipes with a raw, homemade aesthetic, keeping the kitchen settings natural. The books are distinguished by typography, color, and composition. My father’s Chilean book uses bold imagery, a serif typeface, and deep red tones to evoke savory flavors, while my mother’s Finnish book features smaller pieces, a sans-serif typeface, and lighter blue tones, reflecting sweeter dishes.

The motivation comes from global concerns about bee conservation, aiming to answer the key question: what is the situation of bees in the Canary Islands? During the research, important data was gathered on endemic species, their role in pollination, and the threats they face. The main challenges were selecting and synthesizing the abundant information and avoiding common graphic clichés that would detract from the design.",solution:"To avoid graphic clichés, I focused on more specific visual elements. Rather than automatically linking bees to honey production, which doesn't apply to many local species, I chose to highlight their diversity and ecological role with illustrations of the endemic bees. I also avoided stereotypical graphics like hexagons associated with honeycombs, opting instead for comparative diagrams that contextualize the importance of Canarian bees compared to other regions. These strategies helped convey the information clearly and uniquely, moving away from superficial visuals.",images:[{caption:"Infografía exterior",path:"abejas/exterior.png"},{caption:"Infografía naranjas",path:"abejas/naranjas.png"},{caption:"Flyer",path:"abejas/flyer.png"},{caption:"Tote bag",path:"abejas/tote.png"},{caption:"T-shirt",path:"abejas/tshirt.png"},{caption:"Iconography",path:"abejas/icons.png"},{caption:"Illustration",path:"abejas/abejas.png"}]}];export{e as p};
