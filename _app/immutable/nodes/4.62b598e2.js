				Technology teacher showed us Paula Scher’s episode from the Abstract docuseries. From that
				moment on, I was set on becoming a designer.</p> <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 md:gap-8"><p class="w-full md:w-1/3 text-body-base">When I returned home, I enrolled in a vocational program in Multimedia and Web Design, and
					later completed a Graphic Design degree, graduating with honors. Through hands-on,
					project-based learning, I explored editorial, branding, product design and more—gaining a
					strong foundation in layout, typography, strategy and storytelling.</p> <p class="w-full md:w-1/3 text-body-base">After graduating, I focused on the two areas I loved most: editorial design and product
					design. <br/><br/> I’ve since taken courses to build skills in book design, typography, UX,
					human-centered and data-informed methods. I enjoy understanding how users interact with what
					I create and improving experiences through collaboration and iteration.</p> <p class="w-full md:w-1/3 text-body-base">Freelancing has taught me how to manage projects, work closely with clients, and keep
					improving both my process and communication. <br/><br/>Currently, I’m a member of the
					Interaction Design Foundation, where I continuously develop new skills. I also volunteer
					as a visual designer at Habits for a Better World, driving social impact through research
					and design.</p></div></div></div> <div class="h-[1.5px] bg-[#1040b0]"></div> <div class="flex flex-col gap-12"><p class="text-h6 text-center">Where You can Find Me</p> <div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-4 md:gap-8"><p class="w-full md:w-1/2 text-body-base">Based between the Canary Islands and Tübingen, Germany, I&#39;m open to freelance and full-time
