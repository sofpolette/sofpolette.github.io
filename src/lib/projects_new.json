        "description": "An intuitive digital kit for the autonomous development of emotional skills in art and design students.",
        "brief": "The project aimed to enhance art and design students' emotional competencies—an essential factor in their academic, social, and personal success—through design. Students often experience intense emotions such as stress, anxiety, and frustration, which significantly impact their well-being and academic performance. The main challenge was to convey emotional management techniques in an engaging and accessible way for a diverse student audience, varying in gender, age, and personal experiences. Unlike other platforms that primarily focus on achieving happiness, this project adopted an exploratory approach, encouraging students to explore and understand their emotions without the pressure to quickly reach emotional well-being.",
        "solution": "A digital platform was designed to promote self-awareness and emotional self-management. The design process was iterative, focused on making information more accessible and engaging by breaking down content into small, understandable fragments, supported by illustrations that simplify interpretation. The name INFLUYO combines several concepts: The verb INFLUIR (to influence), the use of the first person and the component YO (I) highlights the individual agency of each student. The visual identity is based on the Wheel of Plutchik, using a palette of eight colors that represent different emotions. The logo includes a symbol formed by a circle that abstractly reflects emotion, replacing the last O in INFLUYO.",

The goal was to develop a brand identity that captured the designer’s unique approach to fashion while appealing to women who value individuality, boldness, and sustainability. A key challenge was setting the brand apart in a fashion landscape where most competitors use monochromatic, all-caps logos, while also highlighting its focus on upcycling.",
        "solution": "The brand differentiates itself through its use of color and typography. Instead of relying on a monochromatic palette, I introduced red, light pink, and deep blue to convey the brand’s uniqueness. The logo, composed in lowercase to stand out from competitors, combines a modern sans-serif typeface with a traditional serif, symbolizing the fusion of strength and elegance. The symbol, made from a continuous line that forms a closed shape, represents the cycle of reinvention. Corporate patterns deconstruct and reuse this symbol to reinforce the brand’s emphasis on upcycling and sustainability.",

My father’s Chilean book uses bold imagery, a serif typeface, and deep red tones to evoke savory flavors, while my mother’s Finnish book features smaller pieces, a sans-serif typeface, and lighter blue tones, reflecting sweeter dishes. Despite their differences, both books share a handmade, scrapbook aesthetic, evoking the feeling of sorting through a drawer of memories and family heirlooms.",

The motivation comes from global concerns about bee conservation, aiming to answer the key question: what is the situation of bees in the Canary Islands? During the research, important data was gathered on endemic species, their role in pollination, and the threats they face. The main challenges were selecting and synthesizing the abundant information and avoiding common graphic clichés that would detract from the design.",
        "solution": "To avoid graphic clichés, I focused on more specific visual elements. Rather than automatically linking bees to honey production, which doesn't apply to many local species, I chose to highlight their diversity and ecological role with illustrations of the endemic bees. I also avoided stereotypical graphics like hexagons associated with honeycombs, opting instead for comparative diagrams that contextualize the importance of Canarian bees compared to other regions. These strategies helped convey the information clearly and uniquely, moving away from superficial visuals.",
